Test Manager Module

It has one single interface ( AbstractTestManagerModule<T extends CommonTestSuite>) with one single boolean executeTest(T object) method.
This method makes the common validation on the common properties of all test types and can execute specific tests for each type of test

To test some Hematology type, you need to create a new instance of AbstractTestManagerModule<Hematology> and call executeTest.
This will execute common and specific test (if applies)

To add new types of tests, just need to  create the new domain for this type, with specific attributes and a new implementation class like
"NewTestTypeTMMImpl extends AbstractTestManagerModuleImpl<NewTestType>" and implement the executeSpecificTests with the specific behavior for this new type.
